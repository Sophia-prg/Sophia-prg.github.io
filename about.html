        <h1>How We Started</h1>
        <p> RUBY Radiance was founded on the belief that every individual possesses a unique inner radiance, and their cosmetics are designed to enhance that natural beauty. 
            The company's founders sought to create a line of high-quality, cruelty-free products that empower people to feel confident and express their true selves. They wanted to move away from the 
             often-intimidating world of beauty and offer accessible, inclusive products that celebrate individuality. Driven by a passion for both beauty and ethical practices,
              RUBY Radiance emerged from a desire to offer a more conscious approach to cosmetics. The founders envisioned a brand that not only delivers exceptional results but also aligns
               with their values of sustainability, cruelty-free production, and inclusivity. They saw a gap in the market for makeup that was both effective and ethically produced, and RUBY Radiance 
              was born to fill that void.</p>
              <br>
              <p>With a commitment to quality and a focus on empowering individuals, RUBY Radiance quickly gained recognition for its innovative formulations, vibrant colors, and dedication 
                to ethical practices.The brand's mission is to inspire confidence and self-expression through cosmetics, allowing everyone to embrace their unique beauty. RUBY Radiance
                continues to evolve, introducing new products and expanding its reach while staying true to its core values of inclusivity, sustainability, and empowerment.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Today, RUBY Radiance stands as a symbol of beauty that transcends traditional norms, inviting individuals to celebrate their uniqueness and radiate confidence 
                    in their own skin.</p>
